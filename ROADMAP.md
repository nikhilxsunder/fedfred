### Roadmap

The following outlines the planned direction for the FedFred project over the next year:

1. **Short-Term Goals (Next 3-6 Months):**

   - Add a C++ implementation for faster execution times
   - Improve test coverage to exceed 80% across the codebase.
   - Enhance documentation with more advanced usage examples and tutorials.

2. **Mid-Term Goals (6-12 Months):**

   - Implement support for cuDF and RAPIDS.
   - Introduce support for custom data transformations and visualizations.
   - Improve caching mechanisms for better performance in high-frequency use cases.

3. **Long-Term Goals (Beyond 12 Months):**

   - Add multi-language support for international users.
   - Develop a web-based interface for easier interaction with the FRED API.
   - Explore integration with machine learning frameworks for economic forecasting.

This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and evolving project priorities.
